### Description

BTK Spiel is an online game library site, that allows users to browse, search for, and read about classic, new, or upcoming games. Users can also create an account, and save games to their wishlist, or add them to their list of owned games, keeping track of their library. The data for the site is fetched from the [RAWG.io API](https://rawg.io/apidocs). The site is built using `Next.js`, `MongoDB` (via Mongoose), [`Next-Auth`](https://next-auth.js.org) (for authentication), and uses Next.js Route Handlers (API routes) for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting documents in the database, as well as integrating the site with Next-Auth. I am not usinng any third-party providers within Next-Auth, so validation of credentials, password hashing, and user-accounts are all managed manually. To test the site, click the link, and start browsing or searching for games. Alternatively, create an account and start building a wishlist, and a list of games you own!
